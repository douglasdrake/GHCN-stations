## Weather Station Inventory

As described by [The Global Historical Climatology Network]("https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/land-based-station-data/land-based-datasets/global-historical-climatology-network-ghcn"), the GHCN is an integrated database of climate summaries 
from land surface stations across the 
globe that have been subjected to a common suite of quality assurance reviews. 
The data are obtained from more than 20 sources. Some data are more than 175 years old while 
others are less than an hour old.

As of Version: 3.27-upd-2019081018, there are 113,933 stations in the archive.  
We can search for stations by location and for the measurements that
are available.  This search tool currently limits the measurements to the five primary results: Precipitation, Maximum Temperature, 
Minimum Temperature, Snowfall, and Snow Depth.
